British Sign Language (BSL) is the official language used by the majority of Deaf people in the UK. BSL users are Deaf people, who are mostly born Deaf, to either Deaf or hearings parents. Other users include those that are hearing, yet are born to Deaf parents or those with Deaf relatives. The recent 2011 census estimated that BSL is the preferred language of around people 87,000. Despite its sufficient number of users, it was only until 2003 that BSL was officially recognised as an indigenous language by the UK government.
