BSL cannot be translated into English, however it can be transcribed. Therefore whenever we translate BSL into Engish we capitalise it to indicate a sign in written form. This is useful for compound signs - those with more than one individual sign - to help you, the learner to understand how BSL sign order and sentence structure differs to English sentence structure.
BSL is a visual-gestural language, and therefore does not use sound. This can be quite imitidating for new learners of BSL and often fall into saying the word out loud alongside the sign. You should try to avoid this. To help you associate an sign with an English word, try mouthing the word while carrying out the sign. This will help you remember the sign. As you become more sufficient as BSL you will become more familar with which signs require lip movement and which that don't. This will also help with your lip reading skills, which is important for when you have a sign that has more than one meaning.
